# Project fitmaster
This is a very small personal project, inspired by an application I saw in an article. It is a front-end only application that displays an outfit of clothing, and allows me to shuffle through every item I have for that type of clothing. This outfit is obviously made up of a pair of shoes, pants, and shirt. By clicking on an item of clothing it then flips through all options, allowing me to create an outfit through combinations of every piece of clothing I own. 
The project is developed with Sveltekit. Images are stored locally.
